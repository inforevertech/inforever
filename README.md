# Inforever

Inforever is a data-sharing platform utilizing the Bitcoin blockchain as the platform for information storage. This approach presents some unique advantages, such as censorship resistance, imperishability of records, and unrestricted public access to data for everyone who has access to the blockchain.

Inforever works as a client presenting a user-friendly interface to display and share information in ```OP_RETURN``` statements.

## How it works (early version)
1. Have a private key with some BTC balance to pay transaction fees.
2. Create a message and use your private key to send it to the blockchain.
3. When the transaction is sent and the fee is paid, the message is recorded.
4. Use Inforever Explorer to see and share your messages in a friendly format.
